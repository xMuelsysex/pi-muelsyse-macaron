# Changelog

All notable changes to pi-muelsyse-macaron. After updating, Pi shows the newest
entry once above the editor; run `/muelsyse-changelog` to read this file inside Pi.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-10-04

The bottom-bar choice now covers the input box, and its options carry the project's own name.

### Highlights

- **The interface is one choice**: picking this project in “Bottom bar & input source” (`/zentui` → Features) takes the input box over as well — the Zentui frame replaces Open TUI's rounded editor instead of wrapping it, so its rails no longer show inside the frame. Switching back to `pi-open-tui` remounts its editor and footer.
- **The options are package names**: the setting reads “Bottom bar & input source” and offers `pi-open-tui` / `pi-muelsyse-macaron` instead of a self-referential “本包”.

### Changed

- Wrapping Open TUI's editor left its own rails inside the Zentui frame; the pack installs its own editor now and remembers Open TUI's factory, which the switch back remounts. Its editor bookkeeping also records the factory the host actually holds: Open TUI wraps `setEditorComponent`, so the pack used to fail to recognise its own editor and refused the uninstall.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-04

With pi-open-tui loaded, the bottom bar is yours to choose: Open TUI's footer or this pack's.

### Highlights

- **Bottom bar, your call**: with `pi-open-tui` loaded, `/zentui` → Features → “Bottom bar & input source” switches between this project and pi-open-tui. Both directions apply immediately, whatever order the extensions load in.
- **Ownership moves with the choice**: while this pack draws the bottom line its telemetry and cache-hit settings apply again; while pi-open-tui does, the matching `/zentui` entries read “Managed by /open-tui”.

### Added

- **“Bottom bar & input source” setting** (`statusLineOwner`, default `pi-open-tui`): listed only when `pi-open-tui` is loaded, and leaves every existing setup unchanged by default. Choosing this pack installs its footer and holds other extensions' footers back (Pi has a single footer slot); choosing pi-open-tui remounts the footer factory it registered, so switching back needs no restart.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-04

The header label is yours to set, and the open-tui chrome sits where it does without open-tui.

### Highlights

- **The header label is yours**: `/muelsyse-header "<text>"` replaces the line under the artwork, `status` shows it and `reset` restores the default without pinning it.
- **open-tui parity**: with `pi-open-tui` loaded the working line returns to Pi's status row, and the matrix rain stays above the agent bar, whatever order the extensions load in.

### Added

- **`/muelsyse-header "<text>"`** replaces the line under the header artwork (default `◈  MUELSYSE CYBERDECK  ◈`); `status` shows the current label and `reset` restores the default. The label lives in `~/.pi/agent/muelsyse-macaron-header.json`, must be a single line (tabs, line breaks and escape sequences are rejected) and is clipped from the right when it is wider than the terminal. `reset` deletes that file instead of pinning the current default, so later pack versions keep updating it.

### Fixed

- With `pi-open-tui` loaded, the working line (shimmer HUD) was painted into the editor's top border. Pi draws it in its status row again — above the matrix rain and the agent bar — exactly as without open-tui.
- The matrix rain rendered below other above-editor widgets (Cockpit's `Alt+R Agent` bar) whenever this pack loaded after them — the usual `packages` order at the end of the list. The rain is reordered at render time now, so it always sits above them while the agent bar stays directly above the input box.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

A robustness, performance and "lighter footprint" release based on a full code review
against Pi 0.99.1. Extension code shrank from ~12,000 to ~8,700 lines, the pack no longer
redraws the terminal while idle, and it no longer rewrites tool or command output.
Supported Pi versions: 0.87.1 and newer (tested on 0.87.1 and 0.99.1).

### Highlights

- **Idle means idle**: the footer no longer redraws the screen 4×/second forever (0 bytes written while idle, was ~3.4 KB/s).
- **Your output stays yours**: tool results, `!cmd` output and thinking are shown exactly as Pi renders them — no more added ✓/× glyphs, lost indentation, 200-line caps or replaced lines.
- **Fixed** `/zentui fixed-editor disable` turning off (and saving) the main editor.
- **Fixed** the working HUD being stuck at `↓ 1 token` on Anthropic models, and "done in 0s" after multi-step runs.
- **Safer git**: no more `index.lock` collisions with the agent's own git commands; far fewer git processes.
- **Removed** the obsolete fixed-editor compositor (~1,950 lines); use Pi's native `"tuiMode": "fullscreen"`.
- **Matrix rain is now opt-in** (`/muelsyse-matrix on`) and no longer fights the shimmer.
- **256-color terminals and `NO_COLOR`** are now respected by every effect.
- **New**: this what's-new notice after updates, and `/muelsyse-changelog` to read the changelog inside Pi.

### Fixed — editor, footer and settings (Zentui)

- `/zentui fixed-editor disable|enable|toggle` was parsed as the *editor* switch and disabled the main editor, persisting it to config. Direct commands are now parsed strictly (`/zentui <target> <on|off|toggle>`); anything else shows usage. If this bug turned your editor off earlier, run `/zentui editor on` once.
- Lines you typed in the editor that contained both the model and provider name (e.g. "compare gpt-5 with OpenAI") were deleted from the editor view. Only lines Zentui itself renders are ever stripped now.
- Footer token and cost totals undercounted: compaction, branch-summary, `usage` entries and tool-result usage (subagents / codemode) were missing. Totals now match Pi's own footer.
- An extension status with a key such as `constructor` or `__proto__` crashed every footer render.
- Settings changes (enabling git commit/metrics, package version, footer format, icon mode) did not apply until the next refresh or restart; they now apply immediately.
- Built-in defaults disagreed with what users actually got (refresh interval, footer format, icons). Defaults now come from one place.
- A corrupt `muelsyse-macaron-zentui.json` silently reset every setting to defaults. You now get a warning naming the file and the JSON error, and the file is never overwritten until fixed.
- `$sep` in a custom `footerFormat` always rendered ` | ` regardless of the separator setting.
- Numbers from 999,500 to 999,999 were shown as `1000k` (now `1.0M`).
- A `"bold accent"` style spec dropped the theme color.
- Gradients split emoji ZWJ sequences and combining marks (e.g. accented folder names) into broken pieces.
- The git segment silently froze with stale data when `git status` output exceeded 1 MB (very large change sets); the buffer is now 16 MB and failures show `[git n/a]`.
- Non-English git locales made normal folders look like git errors; git now runs with `LC_ALL=C`.
- Windows absolute paths were not recognised in git path handling.
- Runtime versions ignored the project folder and went stale after `nvm use` / `pyenv local`; they now run in the project folder and refresh when version files change.
- Thinking level `max` had no color of its own (new `colors.editorThinkingMax`).

### Fixed — tool cards, messages and thinking

- `!cmd` output: expanded output was capped at ~19 lines, the bottom border was drawn as a second "BASH · COMPLETE" header, output lines that looked like box edges or `───` rules were replaced by frames, and failed or cancelled commands were labelled `✓ COMPLETE`. `!cmd` output is now stock Pi.
- Tool card bodies were rewritten: syntax and word-diff highlighting was lost, lines starting with `ok`/`Successfully`/`error` got ✓/× glyphs (which were copied with the text), lines starting with `read`/`edit`/`snake_case` words lost their indentation, long lines lost a trailing `...`, expanded output was capped at 200 lines, and collapsed bodies could be replaced by summaries. Bodies are now passed through byte-for-byte inside the muelsyse frame.
- Diff lines lost their indentation around line-number width changes (e.g. lines 95–105).
- Tool card status (running / done / failed) was guessed from the text; it now comes from the tool's real state.
- Clicking a tool card to expand it in fullscreen mode hit the wrong row.
- Clicking a thinking block to show/hide it stopped working in fullscreen mode, per-message thinking toggles were ignored, and visible thinking was cut to 16 lines. Thinking is now stock Pi; hidden thinking shows a muelsyse `✦ Thought` label.
- User messages lost ordered-list numbering (`1)`), backslash escapes and other extensions' markdown transforms. They are now Pi's own rendering inside the rail.
- Prototype patches could leave stale copies behind after uninstall, could stack on reload, and clashed with the upstream `pi-zentui` package's registry.

### Fixed — working HUD (shimmer)

- The live token counter stayed at `↓ 1 token` on Anthropic models while streaming (the provider's early placeholder count was treated as final).
- After an aborted or failed message the count dropped from thousands back to 1.
- The completion notice measured only the last turn ("Sparkled for 0s" after a run with tool calls); it now covers the whole run.
- The completion notice used an invalid notification type, and also appeared after Esc or errors. It now shows only after successful runs, once Pi has fully settled (after retries/compaction).
- The spinner verb changed after every tool call; it now stays the same for the whole run.
- The "stalled" coral fade and the tool-use pulse were never actually shown; both now work.
- The highlight popped in at the left edge instead of sweeping in smoothly; the first thinking frame could glow at a random phase.
- ©, ® and ™ were counted as two tokens each in the live estimate.
- In RPC mode every prompt sent clients a notification full of raw terminal escapes; print/json modes ran animation timers for nothing. Effects now run only in the interactive TUI.

### Fixed — matrix, header, theme

- Matrix listened to `session_switch`, an event Pi removed in 0.65.
- Matrix and shimmer both drove Pi's working indicator; switching matrix off mid-run reset the shimmer to Pi's default spinner.
- `/muelsyse-matrix preview` claimed "5 seconds" but did nothing while disabled or outside the TUI, and stopped the rain for the rest of a running turn.
- A failed matrix settings write left the in-memory state changed without stopping the rain or telling you.
- The header's top padding grew with terminal height (19 blank lines at 50 rows) and changed on every vertical resize; it is now a fixed single line.
- Theme `dim` text failed WCAG AA contrast (3.5:1 → 4.7:1); muted borders are more visible.

### Performance

- No redraws while idle (footer pulse is now opt-in and only runs while the agent works).
- Context-usage and usage-total calculations are cached like Pi's own footer instead of rescanning the session on every frame.
- Working HUD: one ~11 Hz clock instead of three (≈40–55 renders/s → ≤11).
- Git: one `status --porcelain=2 --branch --show-stash` plus one `rev-parse` per refresh instead of ~10 processes; nothing runs when git segments are hidden.
- Runtime/package probes run only when their segments are visible, once per change, never in non-interactive modes.
- Tool cards are cached with no size limit and do no per-line regex work; the gradient cache no longer thrashes on animation frames.
- The clock segment wakes once a minute instead of every second.

### Security and robustness

- A malicious repository could inject terminal escape sequences (e.g. clipboard writes) through `package.json` version, folder names, branch/tag names or runtime output shown in the footer. All external text is now sanitised.
- Git runs with `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` and `-c core.fsmonitor=false`, and project probes (git, runtime, package) are skipped in untrusted projects.
- Config and state writes (Zentui, matrix, changelog) are atomic; broken config files are reported instead of silently replaced.
- Matrix settings now live in Pi's agent directory (respects `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) like the other pack files.
- All UI work is guarded for disposed UIs and non-TUI modes; shutdown cleanup is idempotent; nothing prints with `console.*` while the TUI runs.

### Changed

- **Muelsyse Matrix is off by default** and is now a rain widget only (it no longer changes the working message or indicator). Turn it on with `/muelsyse-matrix on`; saved settings are kept.
- New `/muelsyse-matrix` subcommands: `help`, `height N`; clearer validation and "not saved" messages.
- The footer pulse animation is opt-in: `/zentui pulse on` (setting `animations.footerPulse`).
- New switch `features.messageStyle` (`/zentui messages on|off`) controls message and tool styling independently of the editor. Existing configs keep their previous look: if you had the editor turned off, message styling stays off until you enable it.
- Tool cards keep the muelsyse frame and status rail, but edit/self-rendered tools and image results use Pi's stock rendering.
- The "Thought trail" tree is gone; hidden thinking shows a `✦ Thought` label.
- Header height is fixed; the header is only installed in the interactive TUI.
- Runtime segment detects bun, deno, node, python, go, rust, ruby and java (~50 rarely used runtimes removed). Package version reads `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml` and `composer.json`.
- Default background project refresh is every 60 s (and only when something visible needs it).
- Colors follow Pi's detected color mode: 24-bit on truecolor terminals, nearest 256-color otherwise, none with `NO_COLOR`.
- Theme adds scrollbar and search-match colors for Pi's fullscreen mode.

### Removed

- The experimental fixed-editor compositor (`fixedEditor` settings and `/zentui fixed-editor`). It was already disabled on Pi 0.84+; use Pi's `"tuiMode": "fullscreen"`. Old `fixedEditor` settings are removed from your config automatically (with a one-time notice if it was enabled).
- The `!cmd` output restyling and the tool-body rewriting described above.
- Unused code paths and exports (dual-quota leftovers, dead helpers).

### Added

- A one-time "what's new" notice above the editor after installing or updating (hidden after your next message).
- `/muelsyse-changelog [version]` — scrollable changelog viewer inside Pi.
- `CHANGELOG.md` shipped with the package.

### Developer

- Real unit tests (`npm test`, 100+ tests) and a strict type check (`npm run typecheck`) against Pi 0.99.1; the suite also passes against Pi 0.87.1 (`PI_HOST_ROOT=…`). Set up with `npm run dev:setup` (installs into `.dev/`, nothing is added to the package).
- `scripts/check.mjs` now validates the manifest, shipped files, peer dependencies, theme keys and changelog instead of regex-matching source code.
- The published package no longer ships `scripts/`.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-09-30

- Remove the Codex/Grok subscription quota component, including footer chips, API polling, caching, and the `/dual-usage` command.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-08-08

- **Pi 0.84+**: disable fixed-editor by default and hard-block the compositor on native sticky/fullscreen TUI layouts (prevents broken input after upgrading Pi).
- Document using Pi `tuiMode: "fullscreen"` for sticky editor instead of the experimental fixed-editor compositor.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-07-26

- **Thinking HUD**: remove the brief pink per-thought timer; the muted total turn timer remains.
- **Fixed editor**: cluster mouse clicks now pass through to below-editor widgets while transcript selection stays owned by the compositor.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-26

- **Token HUD**: provider-reported `usage.output` is authoritative and accumulated across tool turns.
- Live stream fallback handles CJK/emoji better than raw `chars / 4`; `~` marks estimated values.
- Labels are readable and compact: `144 tokens`, `1.2k tokens`, `12.3k tokens`, `1.2M tokens`.
- Final usage can correct a live estimate downward instead of leaving an inflated count.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-26

- **Fixed editor**: output completion no longer leaves a blank gap hiding transcript text until scroll.
- Cluster paint now clears only rows it still owns; a focused regression check covers the shrink case.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-26

- **Tool cards**: stop right-edge `...` on every body line.
- **Diff body**: Pi-native `±12 text` without extra `│` gutters eating width.
- **Context gauge**: solid butter (warning) / coral (error) at high %.
- **Tool left rail**: sky / mint / coral status cues.
- **Self-shell tools** (edit): also polished and framed.
- **Startup**: deferred project refresh and other startup work.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-26

- Macaron truecolor footer: gradient separators, pulsed context gauge, sky context text and peach cost.
- Thought trail: muelsyse chrome, tight vertical spacing.
- Tool cards: symmetric frame gradient, path/title color consistency.
- Bundled muelsyse Claude shimmer (effort HUD and verb list).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-22

- Initial theme, header, matrix and Zentui pack.
